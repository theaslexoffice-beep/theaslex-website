    The New Income Tax Bill, 2025:<br />
    What Changes, What Stays, and What It Means for You

    A practitioner's guide to India's biggest tax law overhaul in six decades — beyond the headlines.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- POST BODY -->
<div class="post-body">

  <p>
    On 13 February 2025, the Finance Minister introduced the Income Tax Bill, 2025 in the Lok Sabha.
    Referred to a Select Committee of Parliament, the Bill proposes to repeal and replace the
    Income Tax Act, 1961 — a statute that has governed Indian direct taxation for over six decades,
    survived 35+ amendments, and grown into a 900-section behemoth that even seasoned practitioners
    navigate with difficulty.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stated objective is straightforward: simplify. Make the law clearer, shorter, and
    more accessible. Reduce litigation. Eliminate redundancy. The Bill, at roughly 622 clauses,
    is already shorter than the 1961 Act — though that comparison requires context.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is what every taxpayer, CA, lawyer, and tax professional in India needs to understand
    about what the Bill actually proposes — and what it does not.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Structure: A New Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    The most visible change is structural. The 1961 Act uses "Sections." The new Bill uses
    "Clauses." But beyond nomenclature, the reorganisation is substantive.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bill introduces <strong>"Tax Year"</strong> as the operative period — replacing the
    dual terminology of "Previous Year" and "Assessment Year" that has confused students
    and practitioners alike for generations. Under the 1961 Act, income earned in
    the Previous Year (FY 2024–25) is assessed in the Assessment Year (AY 2025–26).
    The new Bill collapses this into a single concept: the <strong>Tax Year</strong>,
    which is the financial year in which income is earned <em>and</em> in which it is assessed.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    The elimination of "Previous Year" and "Assessment Year" in favour of a unified
    "Tax Year" is the most practically significant structural change in the Bill.
    It will take practitioners — and especially litigation — time to adjust.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Tables and formulae replace long-winded provisions wherever possible. Concepts like
    residential status, TDS schedules, and capital gain computation — historically buried in
    lengthy sections with multiple provisos — are presented in tabular format for the first time.
    For a profession that drafts on the statute, this is a significant shift.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What Is NOT Changing: The Core Framework</h2>

  <p>
    Before examining changes, this is critical: <strong>the substantive tax law is largely preserved.</strong>
    The Bill is primarily a restatement and restructuring exercise, not a new tax policy regime.
    Specifically:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>five heads of income</strong> remain: Salaries, House Property, Business or Profession, Capital Gains, and Other Sources.</li>
    <li>The <strong>basic charging mechanism</strong> — total income computed under the Act, charged at prescribed rates — is unchanged.</li>
    <li>Concepts of <strong>residence</strong> — resident, non-resident, resident but not ordinarily resident — are retained, with minor clarification.</li>
    <li>The <strong>deductions framework</strong> (now reorganised into Schedules) largely mirrors the existing Chapter VI-A structure.</li>
    <li>The <strong>TDS and TCS framework</strong> is preserved, though consolidated and presented more clearly.</li>
    <li>The <strong>assessment, appeals, and search-and-seizure</strong> framework is substantially similar to the existing structure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Anyone telling you the new Bill introduces a fundamentally different tax system is misreading it.
    It does not. What it does is attempt to say the same things more clearly — and in some cases,
    codify positions that were previously only settled by case law.
  </p>

  <h2>3. The "Tax Year" Concept: Practical Implications</h2>

  <p>
    The shift from Previous Year / Assessment Year to a unified Tax Year deserves more attention
    than it has received. Consider what this means in practice:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Limitation periods</strong> will be calculated differently. All existing jurisprudence
      on time limits for reassessment, appeals, and rectification is anchored to "Assessment Year."
      The new Bill's tax year framework will require re-anchoring — and that transition is fertile ground for litigation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Forms and returns</strong> will require redesign. The ITR forms, TDS certificates (Form 16, 16A),
      and all departmental correspondence are currently worded in terms of Assessment Year.
      The transition window could create significant compliance confusion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cross-referencing with other statutes</strong> — particularly GST, FEMA, Companies Act,
      and PMLA — will become more complex during the transition, since those statutes continue
      to reference "Assessment Year" as a term of art.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Key Substantive Changes Worth Noting</h2>

  <h3>4.1 Concept of "Virtual Digital Assets" — Codified</h3>
  <p>
    The Bill formally incorporates the Virtual Digital Asset (VDA) taxation framework —
    previously introduced through amendments in 2022 — as a structured part of the statute
    rather than a bolt-on provision. The 30% flat tax on VDA income, the prohibition on
    set-off of losses, and TDS under Section 194S (now renumbered) are all retained
    and more clearly presented.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 Presumptive Taxation — Expanded and Clarified</h3>
  <p>
    The Bill consolidates presumptive taxation provisions (currently scattered across
    Sections 44AD, 44ADA, 44AE, and others) into a unified chapter. Threshold limits
    are updated to reflect current realities, and the provisions are written with
    greater internal consistency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Importantly, the Bill retains the controversial provision that makes an assessee
    ineligible for presumptive taxation for five years if they opt out in any one year —
    a rule that has generated significant hardship and litigation.
  </p>

  <h3>4.3 Deductions — Schedules Replace Chapter VI-A</h3>
  <p>
    Chapter VI-A of the 1961 Act — the chapter that houses 80C, 80D, 80G, and the rest of
    the deductions universe — is replaced by detailed Schedules in the new Bill.
    The substantive entitlements are largely preserved, but the organisation is cleaner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Notably, the new Bill does <strong>not</strong> introduce new deductions under the
    new tax regime (Section 115BAC, now the default regime). The existing regime's
    simplified approach — higher basic exemption, no Chapter VI-A deductions, lower rates —
    is retained as the default, with the old regime available on opt-in.
  </p>

  <h3>4.4 Capital Gains: The Post-Budget 2024 Framework, Now Codified</h3>
  <p>
    The Finance Act 2024 dramatically overhauled capital gains taxation — introducing
    a unified 12.5% long-term capital gains rate (for most assets), aligning holding
    periods, and eliminating indexation for most assets. The new Bill codifies this
    overhauled framework, rather than the pre-2024 position.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means the new Bill represents the capital gains law <em>as amended in 2024</em>,
    not the original 1961 Act position. Practitioners dealing with legacy transactions
    must be careful about which legal framework applies.
  </p>

  <h3>4.5 Search and Seizure: Tighter Procedural Framework</h3>
  <p>
    The search and seizure provisions — currently housed in Sections 132 to 132B —
    are reorganised in the new Bill with greater procedural clarity. The Bill attempts to
    codify some of the safeguards that courts have read into the existing framework through
    judicial interpretation, including requirements around the existence of "reason to believe"
    before conducting a search.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether these codified safeguards will be interpreted more strictly than their
    judicial predecessors — or whether the department will find ways around them —
    remains to be seen.
  </p>

  <h3>4.6 Tax Deducted at Source: Consolidated and Rationalised</h3>
  <p>
    The TDS provisions in the 1961 Act are notoriously scattered, repetitive, and difficult
    to cross-reference. The new Bill consolidates them into a single chapter with a
    comprehensive schedule mapping transaction types to applicable rates.
    The substantive rates are substantially unchanged from the post-Budget 2024 position.
  </p>
  <p>
    The higher TDS rate for non-filers (currently under Section 206AB) is retained.
  </p>

  <h3>4.7 Faceless Assessment — Embedded in the Framework</h3>
  <p>
    The faceless assessment and appeals framework — introduced in 2020 and subsequently
    litigated extensively — is now structurally embedded in the Bill rather than being
    an added layer through executive notification. This gives it stronger statutory authority
    and, arguably, makes constitutional challenges harder.
  </p>

  <h2>5. What the Bill Does Not Address: The Missing Pieces</h2>

  <p>
    For all its ambition, the Bill leaves several contentious areas essentially untouched:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Transfer Pricing</strong>: The transfer pricing framework, among the most complex
      and litigated areas of Indian tax law, is largely carried forward without substantive reform.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GAAR</strong>: The General Anti-Avoidance Rule provisions are retained
      substantially as they are. Given how little GAAR has been invoked in practice,
      this is perhaps unsurprising.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Disputed Tax Resolution</strong>: There is no new structural mechanism for
      resolving the enormous backlog of pending litigation — no new VSV-type scheme,
      no enhanced settlement commission framework.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>International Taxation</strong>: DTAA override, treaty position, and
      the non-resident taxation framework are carried forward with minimal reform —
      disappointing for a landscape increasingly shaped by BEPS and Pillar Two.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. The Litigation Horizon: Where the Battles Will Be</h2>

  <p>
    Practitioners need to think ahead. When a new statute replaces an old one, the immediate
    litigation questions are predictable:
  </p>

  <h3>Transitional Disputes</h3>
  <p>
    Transactions entered into under the 1961 Act regime — long-term contracts, deferred
    income arrangements, installment transactions — will raise questions about which statute
    governs. The Bill's savings clause will be scrutinised intensely.
    Every tax practitioner should review their clients' open positions before the
    new Bill comes into force.
  </p>

  <h3>Interpretation of New Language</h3>
  <p>
    The old Act has 63 years of case law behind it. Every phrase, every word in the
    key provisions has been interpreted, re-interpreted, and settled — at least partially.
    The new Bill, even where it says the same thing in different words, resets
    that interpretive history. Courts will have to decide whether the new language
    imports the old case law or starts fresh.
  </p>

  <h3>The Tax Year Transition</h3>
  <p>
    As noted above, the transition from Assessment Year to Tax Year will produce
    its own crop of disputes — around limitation, around notices issued before the
    changeover date, and around the computation of time periods that straddle
    the two regimes.
  </p>

  <h3>Constitutional Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    The faceless assessment framework has already faced constitutional challenge.
    Its embedding in the new statute will likely prompt fresh rounds of litigation —
    particularly around due process, natural justice, and the right to be heard.
  </p>

  <h2>7. The Implementation Question: When Does It Come Into Force?</h2>

  <p>
    As of the date of this post, the Bill is before a Select Committee of Parliament.
    The Committee's report is expected before the next Budget session.
    The <strong>earliest realistic date</strong> for the new Act to come into force
    is <strong>1 April 2026</strong> — i.e., Tax Year 2026–27. However, this timeline
    depends on Parliamentary approval and could slip.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the interim, the Income Tax Act, 1961 remains in full force. All existing proceedings,
    assessments, and appeals continue under the old Act. The new Bill makes no change to
    your current compliance obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>8. What Should You Be Doing Now?</h2>

  <p>
    For practitioners and sophisticated taxpayers, there are practical steps worth taking now:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Read the Bill itself.</strong> The text is publicly available. The tabular format
      is genuinely more readable than the 1961 Act. Form your own view — don't rely entirely
      on summaries, including this one.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Map your clients' open positions</strong> against the transition provisions.
      Pending assessments, appeals, pending refunds, carried-forward losses — all of these
      will need to be tracked under both regimes during the transition.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Watch the Select Committee report.</strong> The Committee may recommend amendments.
      Some of the more controversial provisions — the TDS rationalisation, the presumptive
      taxation eligibility rules — may be modified.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Update your systems and forms.</strong> If you manage compliance infrastructure
      — accounting software, ERP, compliance calendars — the Tax Year terminology change
      alone will require system updates. Start planning now.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    The Bill is not a revolution. It is a renovation — long overdue and, in many ways,
    well executed. But renovations have a way of disturbing foundations you didn't
    know were load-bearing.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The Income Tax Bill, 2025, if enacted as introduced, will represent the most significant
    structural change to Indian direct tax law since 1961. But its significance lies as much
    in the transition as in the destination. The next two to five years of Indian tax litigation
    will be shaped as much by the old law as the new one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stay informed. Stay ahead. That's the game.
